# NLP : All my projects and learnings on NLP 

## CLUSTERING PROBLEMS:

### [Clustering companies based on their descriptions](https://github.com/d-saikrishna/NLP/tree/master/Clustering/Cluster%20Companies%20based%20on%20descriptions): 
This problem awas approached in two ways:
1. Each company description was categorised into pre-defined industry segment based on keywords. 
2. Cluster the company descriptions using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method. 
The code is yet to be optimised. 

## CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS:

### [Fake News Classifier](https://github.com/d-saikrishna/NLP/blob/master/Classification/Fake_News_Classifier.ipynb) - An explainer for NLP beginners:
Data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news)
In this code, I explained basics of NLP text processing and used a simple Logistic Classification to predict fake news.
