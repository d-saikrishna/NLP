    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "3.1. **Categorize Companies on the basis of Key-words:** Categorize all companies into the given ten industry segments using the respective keywords. \n",
    "3.2. **Clustering Companies:** Cluster the companies into an optimum number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Pre-processing:\n",
    "The following steps will be performed on short_descriptions of companies:\n",
    "1. **Tokenisation:** Split the text into a list of words in lower-case and after removing punctuation. \n",
    "2. Remove all the stopwords.\n",
    "3. Remove all words that have less than 3 characters. \n",
    "4. **Lemmatization:** Changing words from third-person to first person, past and future tense to present tense. \n",
    "5. **Stemming:** It is reducing a word to its root form. For example, the root form of \"Walking\" is \"walk\" ; \"consultant\" should be reduced to \"consult\". \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Categorise companies using Keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology:\n",
    "1. Write a function that compares the processed list of given industry segments keywords with the processed words of each company description. This function should return a comparison score. \n",
    "2. Industry segment with maximum score will be assigned. \n"
